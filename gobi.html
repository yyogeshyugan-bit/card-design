    <p>Vodka brands, when consumed responsibly in moderation, are often praised for being low-calorie, sugar-free, and carb-free, making them a lighter choice for weight-conscious drinkers, with potential benefits like temporary stress relief, improved circulation (by dilating blood vessels), and supporting heart health (raising good HDL cholesterol), but these benefits are tied to moderate intake and pure vodka, with mixers often adding sugar and calories. </p>
